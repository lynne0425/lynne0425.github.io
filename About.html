      <li>women comprise 47% of the total U.S. workforce and make up to 85% of consumer purchases, they only hold 25% of professional tech occupations</li>
      <li>women are usually far outnumbered</li>
      <li>20% of women remain in junior positions even when they are older than 35, which means that they are “3.5x more likely to be in junior positions” than men of the same age</li>
      <li>Spending money on panels and ads do not make up for a lack of internal inclusion initiatives.  not enough to just hire more women, companies need to put in the effort to make their cultures inclusive from the ground up</li>
